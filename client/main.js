 * This import is automatically generated by Meteor-Vite while building for production.
 * It should only point to your Vite production bundle, and is perfectly safe to remove or commit.

 * If you're seeing this import including any other files like the Vite plugin itself,
 * Meteor might be trying to import ESM over CommonJS. Please open an issue if this happens.
 * Shouldn't be dangerous, but it might bloat your client bundle.
